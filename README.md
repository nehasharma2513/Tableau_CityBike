# Tableau_CityBike

In this project, we are targeting to obtain insights into the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) for the year 2023 by comparing June vs December ridership.

Tableau workbook can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neha.s1667/viz/Tableau_Module18_NYBike_Challenge/StartHourlydistribution?publish=yes)

Following trends were observed based on the analysis and visualizations:

1. Most Popular Start/End Stations
   As seen from the Popular Stations Dashboard area around W 21 St & 6 Ave is one of the most popular start and end destination for riders. This can be attributed to the fact that it is densely populated with a bunch of Restaurants, Bars, Grocery Stores, Parks and Schools. The popularity of this area can be backed up by its [Bike Score](https://www.walkscore.com/score/6th-ave-w-21st-st-new-york) of 92.
   These stations generate the most revenue, hence should be budgedted accordingly.

2. Summer vs Winter Ridership
   As seen from the Summer vs Winter monthly Dashboard, clearly more people ride during Summers and also Casual riders are comparitively higher than Winters. Another important trend to notice is that Members tend to ride more on the Weekdays(mostly people commuting to work/school) whereas Casual riders choose Weekends. Member riders peak occurs on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

3. Hourly Ridership
   As seen from the Hourly Distribution Dashboard, peak ridership for Members occurs in the morning from 7:00-8:00 and in the evening between 17:00-18:00. This again confirms Members ride to and from their workplaces regularly during these hours. Adding more infrastructure during these times could generate more revenue. Casual riders on the other hand tend to bike in the evening hours in Summer and afternoon hours during Winter

4. Bike Type
   As seen in the Bike Type worksheet, riders prefer classic bikes most followed by electric. This definitely stands out as an opportunity for promoting electric bikes for generating more revenue.
